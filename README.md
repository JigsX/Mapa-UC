# MAPA-UC: AN INTERACTIVE MAP FOR UC MAIN CAMPUS

This is my Capstone Research for my undergraduate progrma - Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering @ Universirty of the Cordilleras, Baguio City

The study focused on the design and development of a mobile app for indoor navigation for UC's main campus. The study specifically focused on three main objectives: the identification of information requirements, system features, and the usability of the system. The study was conducted at the University of the Cordilleras, Baguio City, where information regarding campus layout will be gathered and usability testing shall take place. The system is designed as an interactive map to assist the user in navigating and familiarizing the layout of UC's main campus. The user can put their current location (room name or gate number) or scan the QR code that will be placed on each floor and gate to identify their current location and locate their destination room. The user can also locate the closest campus facilities to them. Administrators can modify room arrangements using a dedicated website designed specifically for this purpose.
However, the study was delimited to navigation only, the system has no real-time positioning feature.
